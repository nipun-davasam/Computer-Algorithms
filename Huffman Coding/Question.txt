Write a programs that supports the Huffman coding scheme:

encode:
This takes as input a text file and outputs a text file of bits where each ASCII character in the input file is replaced
by the sequence of bits which represents its Huffman code. Each bit is represented by either the character '0' or the character '1'.


decode:
This takes as input a text file of bits (where each bit is given by either the character '0' or the character '1') 
and outputs a sequence of ASCII characters.
